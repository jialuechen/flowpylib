# Example: Fetching the total supply from an ERC-20 token contract
# This assumes the contract has a `totalSupply` function
total_supply = contract.functions.totalSupply().call()
print(f"Total Supply: {total_supply}")

# Example: Fetching an account's balance
# Replace '0xYourAccountAddress' with the actual account address
account_address = '0xYourAccountAddress'
balance = contract.functions.balanceOf(account_address).call()
print(f"Balance of {account_address}: {balance}")

# Note: Ensure the contract's ABI includes the functions you're trying to call
# and that you're interacting with the correct network and contract address.
